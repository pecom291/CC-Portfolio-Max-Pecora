      <p>
        For this project called Lost and Found we were to think of an object we lost
        in the past and write a detailed description of it. After this we were assigned
        partners and exchanged our descriptions without any pictures or drawings and were
        supposed to create their lost item in p5.

        At first I had a difficult time thinking of something that I had lost in the 
        past and did not want to just do anything. Intially I thought of doing these 
        wireless google pixel earbuds that I had lost but I thought I should do some-
        thing a bit more personal. I decided on writing about a little silver turtle
        necklace that I had when I was younger that had randomly disappeared. It was
        small and about the size of your thumb nail. I remember it resembled that of a 
        sea turtle and had a a thin flat chainlink chain.
        My partner's object named Congrui Lui was a beige book that he had randomly lost as well, his 
        description was "it was a beige book with a plastic cover wrapped around the outside.
        Dried flowers were sandwiched in between the cover and the papers. This book had
        a lot of pages, these pages were not precisely cut and the edges were a little rough. 
        Each piece of paper was mixed with scrapes of plants that gave it a fresh smell"

        At first I had difficulty deciding how I wanted to start this project. I decided I
        would start by first doing a basic beige book from the outside as I was 
        uncertain of how I would represent a plastic cover going over it. Next I 
        chose that I wanted to try and show more than just a beige rectangle and 
        put something where the binding of the paper would be to try and distiguish 
        the back of the book from the front. He had mentioned that the pages of this book 
        were slightly rough and so I created multiple thing rectangles and rotated them
        trying to show a little bit of the front of them and that they were unequal. I
        wasnt sure how i would represent the plants inside of it, so instead I chose 
        to put a flower on the outside of it to help show the contents inside.

        The language my partner used to descibe their object was very detailed. I 
        wasn't entirely sure how I would represent a lot of it initally when I started 
        working on it but found it to slowly get easier over time. The little details 
        such as that "the pages were not precisely cut" was something I found very
        interesting and something that I really wanted to try and represent. In my 
        image I decided to show a book with a flower on it because he said it had 
        plants sandwiched in the pages but I wasnt sure the best way to represent that 
        from the cover. He stated it was a beige book which became the primary focus
        as I thought that would be one of the most distigushing factors. As I 
        delved deeper and deeper into the assignment I found myself trying to add
        more little intricate detailing to make it more and more recognizable, I have
        no idea what the book itself actually looks like but I wanted to make something 
        that would at least reference everything he told me about it. In the end my 
        final outcome was a beige book with uneven pages and a flower on the front.
        I really enjoyed this assignment and look forward to more to come, and had a 
        lot of fun with this considering it was my first time working in it!
