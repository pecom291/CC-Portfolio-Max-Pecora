        Description
      </h2>

      <p>
        For this project we were given the task at first of drawing two simple faces. 
        One face was to be maximum proportions and the other minimum proportions.
        After this we were to take these sketches and import them into p5 and 
        using the random() component and mousePress or keyPress, create a random 
        face generator using the sketches we had done previously.
      </p>
      
      <h2>
        Design Process
      </h2>
      
      <p>
        The design process for this was way more difficult then I initally anticipated 
        at all. At first I didnt fully understand the proper way to use variables in
        order to make all the aspects of the piece move while maintaining some 
        semblence of a face at all. I thought that by moving each piece intially 
        would make it easier but I was completely wrong. Then I struggled to figure out 
        the best way to change the size and shape of each without the face becoming
        too distorted. After a long series of trial and error it all seemed to finally
        which started to make progress a bit faster.

      <p>
        When I first started working on this assignment I though how hard could this be?
        I was very quickly proven wrong with my lack of experience with this program. I
        started by making the background and then creating the eyes, the pupils in the eyes,
        and then finally the mouth. After I had done all of this I recreated the same piece in its 
        minimum version so that I could have an idea of the scale that I would need for the
        random component. Initally while playing with it, everything went absolutely everywhere. 
        Then I realized I had to set variables for each part so that I could change them accordingly. 
        I decided to go with mousePress as I preferred that over keyPress, and started my journey to
        finally finishing. There was a lot of trial and error in inputting the correct numbers for the 
        variables but finally I made something that made me happy and laugh whenever I clicked that 
        was all intentional.

      <h2>
        Reflection
      </h2>
      
      <p>
        Through this assignment I learned that this entire process what a lot trickier then it seems. 
        I saw this assignment and was feeling really confident regarding it, and it really made me 
        sit down and spending quite a bit of time on it before it fully made sense. I learned that 
        though something as simple as a few rectangles to make a face, when translated into code
        does not necessarily make it easier only more complicated. I found it extremely interesting
        figuring out the different ways to make things work and how to get them to properly place.
        Though in the end some of the faces come out a bit wonky they really made me have a great time
        during the entire assignment. Things you could hand draw so simply can become much more
        complicated just with one simple command such as random.
