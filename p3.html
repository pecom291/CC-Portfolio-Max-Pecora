        Desciption
      </h2>
      
        <p>
        For this project we were given the components to make a clock of our own choosing. 
        This experimental clock is novel to me in a number of different ways. First it was actually based
        off the alarm clock that wakes me up every morning for work and school. This helps me to keep track
        time on a daily basis allowing me to understand when I do and don't have to wake up. External factors
        heavily influence my life such as work and school because of time management. Having 
        another clock to assist with that is nothing but beneficial allowing me to be more 
        on time and frustrated having to wake up so early.

      <h2>
        Design Process
      </h2>
      
        <p>
          For the design process, initally I started by choosing the design that I wanted to do 
          from the sketches that I had made. I decided to go with my first sketch as it's very similar
          to the alarm clock I use every day that helps me wake up for school and work on time. I 
          started by created the main frame for the clock including the center, the body of the clock,
          the snooze button, and the ON and OFF buttons. After this was done I changed the colors accordingly
          to make sure that everything was as accurate as possible and made the most sense. Detailing was
          added to the side of the clock as for some reason mine has small vents on the side of it 
          that I wanted to incorperate. When I finished with the base design of the alarm clock 
          it was time to start working on the primary focus which would be the time itself, alligning
          the text to the center of the clock, setting up the AM and PM symbols and for them to switch every 12 hours.
          This process was extremely tiring and much more difficult then anticipated. Something so simple
          can take a lot more work going into it than you would really ever think, especially such a 
          simple alarm.

      <h2>
        Reflection
      </h2>
      
      <p>
        I really enjoyed this assignment and getting to learn much more about all the components that 
        actually go into it. Thinking about such a simple clock you done think about how much it takes
        to make it until you are smack in the middle of attempting to make it. Working with the IF component
        was very interesting and how to set it up in the code took a bit of trial and error before it 
        finally decided to work (or until I actually did it properly). While this wasn't something 
        I had ever thought of having to make before it was much more fun then I thought it would have been. 
        As someone who's life runs a lot around the alarms I set myself to wake up on time and to get where 
        I need to be on time, it was quite fun recreating these in a coding/digital manner.
