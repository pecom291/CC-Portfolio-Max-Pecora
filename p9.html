      <h2>
        Description
      </h2>
      
      <p>
        For this assignment we were to reuse our experimental camera in P5js and add an interface with a consent feature to it
        for anyone that uses it,  while using the F.R.I.E.S model as a reference. This means instead of immediately going to 
        the camera users will have the ability to confirm or deny access to their cameras/webcams to use the experimental camera. 
      </p>
      
      <h2>
        Design Process
      </h2>
      
      <p>
        The design process for this project was not to difficult given that we were just adding an interface to the last assignment
        that would allow someone to confirm or deny the cameras useage. The inital process that started this project was working 
        on a flowchart in our sketchbooks that showed how we wanted the interface to act. After the flow chart was finished it 
        was discussed in class and then taken to be worked on in P5js.
      </p>

      <p>
        While working in P5js the first thing that I did was create scenes. That way when the experimental camera was 
        started it would not immediately open to the camera but ask for a "Yes" or "No" prompt and a disclaimer would pop up
        to show that the camera would be in use. This would allow the user to access or deny access to the experimental camera. 
        The yes will take you staight to the camera where there is a "END" button that allows the user to turn it off anytime 
        they would like. Once the end button is hit it will take you to another scene where the "No" button takes you which is 
        the end screen that thanks the user for using it and reminds them of how to stay safe. The overall goal for this 
        interface is to give users the ability to decide if they want to use it or not instead of immediately throwing them 
        into it.

      <h2>
        Reflection
      </h2>
      
      <p>
        The FRIES model is incorperated into my project in a few different ways.<br>
        Freely given: the user is not being pressured to do anything. They can decide whether or not they want to use my camera.<br>
        Reversible: if the user decides not to use the came at that moment they have the option to go back to the main menu.<br>
        Informed: The user is aware that the program requires access to their camera before using the filters.<br>
        The interface that I created allows the user to determine if they would like to use the camera or not and 
        not just have it thrown in their face. It recontectualizes the little things that personally I would have 
        never thought about in creating a project like this. I happened to learn a lot about consent through this as 
        well and hope the interface is something that everyone who uses enjoys! (:
