        Description
      </h2>
      
      <p>
        For this assignment we were given the task of tracking a habit of hours and creating a 
        log of what it is and when it happens throughout a week. With this data log we were given
        the task of creating our own "data portrait" which is our own data chart that we make through 
        p5js to represent the data we collected over the given week.
      </p>

        The First Row of dots represents the amount of hours playing my game. <br>
        The Second Row of dots represents the amount of hours doing anything else besides my game. <br>
        The Third Row of dots represents the amount of sleep I got on those days. <br> <br>
        
        Doing one of these tasks for 2-4 hours is Purple. <br>
        Doing one of these tasks for 5-7 hours is Orange. <br> <br>
        
        Doing one of the tasks for over 20 hours is Green. <br>
        Doing one of the tasks for less than 20 hours is Black

      <h2>
        Design Process
      </h2>
      
      <p>
        My process for this assignment was a bit confusing at first as per usual as I tried to 
        figure out something that I do on a constant basis that I can track. At first I thought 
        about doing something like amount of times I used the bathroom but figured that was a bit
        gross and decided against it. I ended up landed on tracking the amount of time that I play games,
        the time I do anything else, and the amount of time that I spend sleeping. These are all things I
        normally think about and something I was curious how it would look laid out.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        For the beginning of my process I wasnt sure how I wanted to represent the hours in each category. 
        I decided on circles that expand and shrink depending on the amount of time in each day and category. 
        I put each of the types of data into seperate lines to make them easier to read and changed the colors
        according to the amount of time spent on each.
      </p>
      
      <h2>
        Reflection
      </h2>
      
      <p>
         I learned that I play games just about as much as I sleep on days that I can and I thought that was
        actually really funny. Ive grown up playing video games my entire life so this was no surprise to me, 
        but I did really enjoy putting it into a data format and into a data portrait to be able to see it in
        a different manner. What I think was really lost through the form of data tracking was the amount of time 
        truly represented in each. Hours in a day can feel quite large or long depending on what we are doing. I think
        of the saying "time flys when your having fun" quite frequently and can say it does not feel that long while playing games.
        I wise there was a way to really show how much time is being lost through playing these games rather than doing
        something else, however I do love them and would be quite bored without them so I can only be grateful. Overall
        I'm quite happy with how it came out and thought the color choices were interesting too.
