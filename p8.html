      <h2>
        Description
      </h2>
      
      <p>
        For this assignment we were given the task of creating an experimental camera using createcapture
        and array in our pseudocode. This allows us to create our own camera of sorts that would allow us
        to take pictures using our own filter however we wanted. The first part of the process was coming 
        up with three different ideas that were discussed in class and the second part was choosing 
        one of these ideas and implimenting it through P5js.
      </p>
      
      <h2>
        The Experimental Camera meaning
      </h2>
      
      <p>
        The experimental camera I created uses a combination of the blur effect, delay image copying (to
        make the slow motion looking effect), blendmode, and filters. Blendmode(HARD_LIGHT) is activated to get the interesting
        color scheme that makes the blur effect work even better than by itself. The filters are activated through sensing if you
        are smiling or serious. If you are serious then the filter implimented is filter(THRESHOLD) which turns the entire screen 
        black and white (making for a very creepy picture that I was inspired by from a project I did last year). The purpose 
        of the camera is overall to make things a little more interesting and to get a different perspective of how
        photography works in different ways, and overall to create an eerie enviorment. The normal background is very vibrant 
        (despite the lighting in my basement) which in itself can seem creepy. But when the filter kicks in the entire 
        piece becomes something entirely different and allows the user to sense an even darker and creepier picture. 
      </p>

      <h2>
        Design Process and Inital Idea Sketches
      </h2>
      
      <p>
        Initally while coming up with the different ideas that could be implimented through the camera, I thought I would 
        just use the blur feature as well as play around with the different blendmodes through different facial reactions 
        to creature different pictures depending on how you were looking. That is what my first sketch was going to be, for
        my second sketch the idea was to segment the image into different pieces and use the blur feature to change the view
        of the piece itself so that it would act in a way to hide the viewer from anyone looking at the camera as well as 
        create an interesting piece that anyone looking at would have to spend a little time to decipher to understand. The 
        third idea that I had was to try and find a way to incorperate noise in the piece which would cause a ripple/distortion
        effect making the piece blurrier and grainer depending on how loud it was and a normal image when it was quite. Eventually
        I decided to go with the first sketch idea but also implimented a little bit more into it as I found myself doing the project 
        and thought that it would be quite boring if I only implimented those two things.
      </p>

      <p>
        When working on the experimental camera the setup was not that bad as most of how to do it was completely covered in 
        the classes allowing for a firm grasp of how to set it up using createcapture and the array elements. The little bit of difficulty 
        came when trying to fully impliment the blur aspect and working the on little color changes throughout that make 
        the blur and blendmode work the best that they could. After figuring out how to set these up correctly next came the 
        idea of implimenting a way to determine how the camera would change from normal to threshold (which was kind of difficult due 
        to my basement being really dark, but I liked the feel of how creepy the camera looked.) Initally it was going to be off 
        where you were positioning inside of the camera (left or right) but after some research I found a way to impliment it off 
        of facial features which allowed me to base it off if you were smiling or serious (which also the dark basement didn't help.)
        After all of this was set up came working on the best ways to portray the camera. I tried my best to show in the images how the
        camera works and even went and got my cat to see in the camera was working properly and didn't work on just me.
      </p>
      
      <h2>
        Reflection
      </h2>
      
      <p>
        When working on designing this unconventional camera I learned a vast amount about the different ways that arrays could be used
        as well as the many different implimentations that this could have throughout other works. Being able to create a camera of your 
        choosing is a really interesting concept and I wish I knew how to do this sooner as I could have definitely used this for many 
        assignments in the past. The process of seeing in the camera I made in differently entirely shaped by me which is kind of crazy 
        to think about. The different colors implimented along with the blendmode, tint, and filter allow for a camera that can not only 
        be used for one purpose but a few different ones that allow for the ability to precieve things in different ways. Working on this
        assignment was a lot of fun and definitely felt like a break after the difficulty of working on the last assignment. My personal 
        favorite part is that I will definitely be coming back to use this for a few projects in the future as it will definitely save 
        me a lot of time instead of working through photoshop.
