      <h2>
        Description
      </h2>
      
      <p>
        For this assignment we were given the task of creating our own bitmap autobigraphical game using P5js. We were
        allowed to do anything we wanted it just had to be something that directly related to us. The type of game, gameplay, 
        and variables in the game could be anything we wanted just using the design elements that we have learned so far.
      </p>
      
      <h2>
        Proposal and Storyboard
      </h2>
      
      <p>
        The proposal for my game was to make something regarding my experience throughout highschool at 
        St. Francis Preparatory School. Passing in this school was 75 so making sure your grades were high was
        something that haunted me for a long time even when first coming into this school. I wanted to recreate my 
        experience of this through seperate scenes on what a day at my school would look like for me. While also 
        including what I did in my free time after school. 
      </p>

      <h2>
        Design Process
      </h2>
      
      <p>
        The design process for this game was unbelieveably difficult. There were many points at every stage of it that I
        did not understand a lot that was going on or the direction I even wanted to continue from. This wasn't because of
        what we had learned, it was because I was struggling to impliment it properly to do so. Initially I started by laying
        out the scenes with unfinished or random images just to give myself an idea of placement as well as anything else 
        that needed to be added later on. From this I fine tuned and finished up everything else making sure that the entire
        piece itself could be replayed, or restarted it failed. Then it was getting to work to get all the details and everything
        order along with the grey boxing section that took longer than it should have. I would say this went smoothly but I can say 
        it went the exact opposite. While trying to position some of the barrier or other things around I found myself not being able 
        to move them properly or get the correct proportion sizes for the things that I needed them for. In the end they were places 
        almost exactly where they needed to be but I could not figure out the exact perfect positioning for the life of me.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Past the grey boxing began the process of sucessfully texturing the piece. This was actually the easiest part as I had planned 
        ahead and actually placed textures on everything I would need initally to be able to speed through this step. I first added the
        textures that I needed and then proceeded to take them into photoshop and fix them up. Once this was done various playthroughs 
        were done to make sure they were the correct size and shape. Once this was all finished and polished I ran through a few more 
        times just to make sure that the entire game was finished and completed. As far as I could tell everything was perfectly in order
        and doing exactly what it was supposed to do!
      </p>
      
      <h2>
        Reflection
      </h2>
      
      <p>
         I want to start my reflection by saying this was a long and stressful process. The amount of other projects assigned in other 
        classes made me feel slightly overwhelmed trying to make sure this and those got done on time and with the equal amount of 
        work and effort put into them. Overall though I did throughly enjoy making this project and being able to say I offically made 
        a game myself is wonderful. The part I struggled with the most was definitly the grey boxing and getting those to work properly. 
        Some barriers in the game are still placed strangely however they do work as they were intented to. My favorite overall part 
        was retexturing at the end and being able to see the entirety of the piece in its finished glory. Though with silly messages, 
        it does feel like a very particular feel to what I really did feel like while going through that school. The character is even
        in a red shirt and grey pants because there was a uniform that HAD to be worn at all time and I thought that was an important 
        thing to add as it really completeled the overall feel I was going for. I hope anyone who plays enjoys!
