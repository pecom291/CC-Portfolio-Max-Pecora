      <h2>
        Description
      </h2>
      
      <p>
        For this assignment we were given the task of creating an optical illusion
        that moves using p5js. Initally we had to choose three patterns of our choosing,
        then in some way animate them in our own way and/or make them move with the IF/ELSE function.
      </p>1
      
      <h2>
        Design Process
      </h2>
      
      <p>
        My process for this assignment was a bit wonky at first. I don't really have 
        many specific cultural patterns so in the end I chose to do something I saw 
        as visually appealing. Initally I started by creating the base layer or background
        for my pattern. This was a bunch of lines varying in color to give off the 
        impression that it was moving. Next I decided to change the colors to be
        variations of the color (in this instance blue) that started to make the piece
        itself seem like it was tilting at different angles depending on where 
        you were looking. These colors that varied were looped so that they spread throughout 
        the rest of the page.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        For the next part of the process I decided I wanted to add little boxes throughout 
        the rest of the piece that rotated at the same time. By using the IF/ELSE function,
        this allowed me to be able to move these in unison and duplicate them across the page as
        well using the loop function. Once this was all done I changed the colors of these little 
        squares to be the highest variation of the primary color (blue) and its counterpart (orange)
        to make the eyes a bit more confused when looking at the piece. This assists in the 
        optical illusion taking place.
      </p>
      
      <h2>
        Reflection
      </h2>
      
      <p>
         Some impacts and effects of translating the pattern into being digital was that 
        certain components in the pattern itself were just not there or didn'g make sense to
        include in the pattern. It had to be slightly simplified in order to be able to do the 
        most of what was going on and for it to make the most sense. When creating the optical illusion
        itself and the many tiny rotating boxes, while the pattern itself did lose a little bit of 
        what it initally was it ended up gaining more in the end. This is because while it 
        is not the same pattern that it started with, its been altered accordingly to fit 
        with the new layout and everything that is going on.
