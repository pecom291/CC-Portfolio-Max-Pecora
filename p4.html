      <p>
        For this assignment we were given the task of creating a human or none-human form 
        with a head, body, and lower body. This creation was then shared during our next 
        class and we were assigned 2 partners to trade 2 parts of our creation with theirs 
        to create an all new creature. I was assigned to work with Maiia and Rainy and 
        all of our creations were hysterical.

      <h2>
        Design Process
      </h2>
      <p>
        The process for coming up with my creation was intially quite silly. I originally made
        something in photoshop but did not like the outcome so I ended up remaking something 
        with a pencil and paper in my sketchbook. This creation would be named "kitty, bee, squid experiment."
        The backstory behind this creation was that he was a failed science experiment that 
        ended up breaking free and getting away. Not much is known about him however, it is known
        he still roams free in strange and mysterious places and pops up on occasion unexpectedly 
        for no reason whatsoever. 
      </p>
        
      <p>
          My partner Rainy came up with the fat merman who was very hairy and very silly.
        His story was that he was a large mermaid that absolutely loved to dance and eat. My other partner
        Maiia created an alien bug which was quite strange and had wings that did absolutely nothing 
        for it as its evolution made them unnecessary. They came from an alternate demension of earth
        that happened to have a fallout and now take the place of mankind. After discussing the different ways we could 
        split out beings up, I decided to use the head of the merman and the lower end of the alien 
        bug. 
      </p>
       
      <p>
        Initally while piecing these together I struggled with the X and Y axis as I couldn't 
        figure out the best way to resize them. After this I struggled with trying to get them 
        into the proper places so that they all werent seperated. After a while and some 
        online searching I finallu figured out the best way to get these things to work together. 
        I decided I didnt want my creation to not be able to move so I incorperated transalate(mouseX, mouseY)
        in order for my creation to fly around the page. This then took more struggling as I had to figure out
        how to realign the entire thing. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The final creations story is that he is a very strange being unsure of why or how he was made. His head
        is way too small for his body and he is quite disproportional. He doesn't really like people 
        and has a lot of self esteem issues however he tries to make the most of everything. He's from a
        world where everything is random and there is no way to determine anything as definite as everything changes 
        constantly. His father was a mermaid and his mother was a space alien bug from another demension that so happened 
        to randomly get teleported into his world. Despite his appearance he is actually one of the nicest people 
        and makes some fantastic frappachinos.

        Reflection

      <p>
        This is easily my favor project by far in regards to the work and everything else that went into it. 
        Working with my partners was a lot of fun and not knowing what to expect with the outcome of the 
        creation made it more and more fun to work with. Learning how to use function, arguments, and parameters
        was not the most difficult thing so far but I can already tell will be one of the most useful 
        for assignments past this. Im really happy with the outcome and despite his not so welcoming 
        appearance I hope that anyone who views him enjoys him too.
